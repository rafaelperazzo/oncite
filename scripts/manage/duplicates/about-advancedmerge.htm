<h2>Using the advanced merge tool </h2>
<p>The data in the <strong>drop-down menus</strong> represent areas of differences between the duplicated records. In many cases the difference may only be a simple spelling mistake, or an abbreviation used in one record versus the full text in another. With authors, the difference may only be that a comma or period was omitted from one record.
</p>
<p>Where there is <strong>no drop-down menu </strong> then the data is the same in all of the selected records (blank fields are ignored).</p>
<p>Advice for specific fields:  </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Originator:</strong> The user IDs of the records' originators are stored, but only one can be kept in the merged record. Choose your own user ID if it appears there - otherwise choose whatever seems most appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Pubid:</strong> This lists the ids of the duplicated records. The merged record will take on the id that you select. The publication id that is not selected will be deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>URL:</strong> If there are multiple URLs then you may need to exercise judgment about which is the best to keep. PubMed URLs (shown as &quot;pm:&quot; followed by a number) are often useful to keep since they may link to full-text options. <em>(Eprints records will also have extra fields - &quot;oaiid&quot; and &quot;eprint&quot; - which are used to create additional Eprints-derived links. These are separate from the URL field.)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>After you have made any selections and  elected to merge the records, you will still be able to edit the record to make any further adjustments.</p>
